## KI-News

**Flux.1 und Scenario**: Andâ€¦ [It works with THREE characters together](https://x.com/emmanuel_2m/status/1842168403873685536). ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥° Three LoRAs, three custom-trained characters (references below).

**Pika 1.5 Is Finally Here**: [AI Video Just Took A Huge Step](https://generativeai.pub/pika-1-5-is-finally-here-ai-video-just-took-a-huge-step-0d88400b7ac1). In just the past few months, we've seen a whirlwind of activity in the AI video space. Runway released a new [video-to-video](https://generativeai.pub/runway-introduces-gen-3-alpha-a-new-hyper-realistic-ai-video-generator-b50cb6f3875e) model, Kling AI rolled out [Kling 1.5](https://generativeai.pub/kling-ai-1-5-is-out-with-better-video-quality-faster-generation-and-more-69f96670b01f) with motion-brush and lip-syncing features, and Vidu launched new video models with super-fast generation speed. Today, Pika joins the club with the release of its new video model, **[Pika 1.5](https://pika.art/)**.

**Flux 1.1 Pro Is Here**: [Better and Faster Image Generation](https://generativeai.pub/flux-1-1-pro-is-here-better-and-faster-image-generation-5d2f1105ed93). Black Forest Labs has just released its most advanced, efficient, and powerful open-weights image model to date: **[Flux 1.1 Pro](https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-flux-1-1-pro-and-the-bfl-api/)**. This new image model offers a significant performance boost, delivering six times faster generation speeds than its predecessor while also improving image quality, prompt adherence, and overall diversity.

## Lua Carousel

**New version after 3 months, and turtle graphics**: [This version](https://akkartik.itch.io/carousel/devlog/810479/new-version-after-3-months-and-turtle-graphics) may matter a lot to some people. I massively sped up `print` calls in Carousel. So if you are in the habit of printing a lot to the lower half of the screen, you'll want this.

Someone asked me if LÃ–VE or other languages support [Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) like in Logo. The answer is: no, but it's easy to build. Then of course I had to build it in Carousel.
