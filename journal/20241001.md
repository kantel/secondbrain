**Flux.1-Dev**: [Photorealistic (and Cute) Images](https://www.mlexpert.io/blog/flux-1-dev). When I first saw images generated by the Flux.1 models from Black Forest Labs, I had to pause and wonder whether they were AI-generated or crafted by a human. The most exciting part? Some of these models come with open weights, so you can try them out too!

**Welcome Flux**: [The Groundbreaking FLUX.1 Model](https://medium.com/generative-ai-art/the-groundbreaking-flux-1-model-497126cbec90). A New Era in AI Image Generation, included ComfyUI workflow.

**How to Train a FLUX.1 LoRA for $1**: [Step-by-Step Guide to Training on X-Rays (or any kind of Image)](https://medium.com/@geronimo7/how-to-train-a-flux1-lora-for-1-dfd1800afce5). FLUX.1 took the world by storm, and in this post, I’ll walk you through how to train a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on custom images, enabling FLUX1 to learn specific styles or characters and reproduce them. I chose something a bit unusual as my target: X-ray images!

**Flux**: [How to Control Image Layout and Background Sharpness Using Prompts and LoRA](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/flux-how-to-control-image-layout-and-background-sharpness-using-prompts-and-lora-ca8107505559). Hello, everyone! Today, I’m excited to share some key techniques I’ve learned while experimenting with the Flux model. Over the past few days, I’ve generated about 500 images, tweaking prompts and LoRA to see how different prompt structures can control image layout and background sharpness. In this article, I’ll walk you through these techniques and show how you can use them in your own image generation projects.

**Unlocking the Diffusion Model Power**! [Introduction of Tuning-free Style Transfer Method: InstantStyle](https://generativeai.pub/unlocking-the-diffusion-model-power-507a70f9c23d). This article introduces a novel tuning-free style transfer method for the Diffusion model, »InstantStyle: Free Lunch towards Style-Preserving in Text-to-Image Generation.« Although many style transfer methods have been developed, tuning-free style transfer methods are rare. The advantages of the tuning-free method are that we don’t need to prepare a dataset or additional computation resources(!). In this blog, we will explore the theoretical background of InstantStyle, learn how to implement it in Python, and check its performance.
